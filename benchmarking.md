<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Benchmarking </h1>

We present two classification experiments performed using the 2019 version of the dataset to infer the main crop types present in each image. In the first experiment, *static classification*, we treated each individual image as a training instance (static image classification). In the second experiment, *dynamic classification* we explored the use of a temporal image series as an input.

Tables showing results for both experiments are figured below.
